# Digital-Power-Electronic-Software-NOTES
> A concise collection of topics and focus areas for digital power-electronics firmware development.  

#### 1. Power-electronics Fundamentals: isolation, protection and EMI/EMC.
#### 2. PLECS / MATLAB Simulation Tools: component modeling, parameter setup and scripting.
#### 3. Design calculations for main power components (magnetics, capacitors, snubbers, heat dissipation).
#### 4. Control strategies for major topologies, loop design, and debugging tips (LLC, CLLC, Buck, PFC, DAB, three-phase).
#### 5. Loop analysis and control theory : bandwidth, phase/gain margin, compensation networks and digital implementation considerations.
#### 6. Low-level (LL) libraries: on-chip peripheral drivers and deterministic access patterns.
#### 7. MCU core framework and support functions (STM32 example): memory map, bootloader, watchdogs, startup sequence.
#### 8. TI DSP usage: architectures, fixed-point vs floating-point considerations, interrupt model.
#### 9. Peripheral subsystems: ADC sampling strategies, synchronisation, filtering, and communication interfaces (SPI, CAN, UART, IÂ²C).
#### 10. Reusable modular code: frames, driver/hal layers, component drivers, configuration tables and testing hooks.
#### 11. Advanced C: pointers, memory model, volatile/atomic usage, optimization pitfalls and compiler behavior.
#### 12. Real-time OS usage (FreeRTOS): task design, priorities, ISR-to-task handover and resource protection.
#### 13. Tool chains and IDEs: advanced usage of Keil, STM32CubeMX / CubeIDE, TI CCS and build/debug workflows.
#### 14. Development & debugging ecosystem: HMI tools, protocol analysers, hardware-in-the-loop, deugging tools, and CI for firmware.
